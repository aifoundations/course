# Long Short-Term Memory Networks Exercise

LSTMs let us predict values in a sequence.

## Notebooks

See the following notebooks:

## Datasets

Choose any dataset you like, or one of the below! Then adapt the notebook above to use that dataset.

Optionally, try to build a closed-loop prediction model instead of an open-loop model.
