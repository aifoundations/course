# Neural Network Exercise

Neural networks enable us to predict values while capturing complex, non-linear relationships in the training data.

## Notebooks

See the following notebooks:

## Datasets

Use the same dataset you used for the [Linear Regression Exercise](./01%20Linear%20Regression.md). Then train a simple neural network, and compare the RMSE of the linear regression model and the neural network.
