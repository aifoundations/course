# Neural Network Exercise

Neural networks enable us to predict values while capturing complex, non-linear relationships in the training data.

## Datasets

Use the same dataset you used for the [Linear Regression Exercise](./01%20Linear%20Regression.md) or the [Logistic Regression Exercise](./02%20Logistic%20Regression.md) and train a simple neural network to perform the same task. Compare the results of the new model.
